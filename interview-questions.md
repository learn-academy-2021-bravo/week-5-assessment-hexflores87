# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean?

  Your answer: I'm not sure of what it the acronym stands for but I do know it provides the framework for a webpage.

  Researched answer: Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages



2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: A relational database is a collection of data. I believe its related to a data base by using commands to communicate with the database.

  Researched answer: A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data. A software system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system.



3. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer: Object-relational mapping is just by looking at the word giving a guide or form to the data base. I used the definition on top to guide me with this answer but will reseasrch the answer to get a better understanding of this process.


  Researched answer:Object–relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages. This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database". ORM (Object-relational mapping) is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible systems using object-oriented programming languages. ORM is a tool that allows developers to write SQL queries using Rails.





4. What is a gem?

  Your answer: a gem is related to the Ruby language. I know it is a tool that is needed to support ruby.  

  Researched answer: RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries, a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer:  A primary key is what holds the values for the databases. They are important so that your records are identified using specific keys.

  Researched answer: In the relational model of databases, a primary key is a specific choice of a minimal set of attributes that uniquely specify a tuple in a relation. Informally, a primary key is "which attributes identify a record", and in simple cases are simply a single attribute: a unique id. They are important because they ensure row-level accessiblity. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: A RESTful route is a route that provides mapping from HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to controller CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). Instead of relying solely on the URL to indicate what site to visit, a RESTful route depends on the HTTP verb and the URL.

2. JSON: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.


3. Model validations:Model validation is the set of processes and activities intended to verify that models are performing as expected.

4. Strong params:Strong Parameters is a feature of Rails that prevents assigning request parameters to objects unless they have been explicitly permitted. It has its own DSL (Domain Specific Language, or in other words, a predefined syntax it understands), that allows you to indicate what parameters should be allowed.J

5. API:API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
